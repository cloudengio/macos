# Package [cloudeng.io/macos/buildtools](https://pkg.go.dev/cloudeng.io/macos/buildtools?tab=doc)

```go
import cloudeng.io/macos/buildtools
```


## Constants
### BashInstallPreamble
```go
BashInstallPreamble = `#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
mount="$1"
installer_pid="$2"
target="$3"

TARGET_USER=$(stat -f "%Su" /dev/console)
TARGET_HOME=$(eval echo ~$TARGET_USER)
`

```
BashInstallPreamble is the standard preamble for install scripts used in
pkgbuild packages.

### SafariWebExtensionPointIdentifier
```go
// SafariWebExtensionPointIdentifier is the NSExtensionPointIdentifier of a
// Safari web extension, ie. one that uses the WebExtensions API and a
// manifest.json.
SafariWebExtensionPointIdentifier = "com.apple.Safari.web-extension"

```



## Functions
### Func CWDFromContext
```go
func CWDFromContext(ctx context.Context) string
```
CWDFromContext retrieves the current working directory from the context,
as set by ContextWithCWD. If no directory has been set in the context the
function returns the process's current working directory at the time that
this package was initialized. Note that this may differ from the actual
current working directory of the process if it has changed since the package
was initialized or if another package that was initialized earlier has
changed the current working directory of the process.

### Func ContextWithCWD
```go
func ContextWithCWD(ctx context.Context, cwd string) context.Context
```
ContextWithCWD returns a new context with the specified current working
directory. CommandRunner will use this directory for executing commands.

### Func GUIDomain
```go
func GUIDomain() string
```
GUIDomain returns the launchd GUI domain target for the current user.

### Func NativeMessagingHostsDir
```go
func NativeMessagingHostsDir(browser BrowserType, scope NativeMessagingScope, home string) (string, error)
```
NativeMessagingHostsDir returns the directory that browser searches for
native messaging manifests, into which the manifest for a helper must be
installed for an extension to be able to launch it. home is the user's home
directory and is ignored for SystemScope.

Safari does not use native messaging manifests: a Safari web extension sends
native messages to the .appex that contains it, so an error is returned for
it. See AppBundle.AddSafariWebExtension.

See https://developer.chrome.com/docs/apps/nativeMessaging and
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests

### Func RegisterFlagsOrDie
```go
func RegisterFlagsOrDie(f any, fs *flag.FlagSet)
```
RegisterFlagsOrDie registers a struct that contains an instance of
CommonFlags with the provided FlagSet, panicing on error.

### Func UserLaunchAgentsDir
```go
func UserLaunchAgentsDir() (string, error)
```
UserLaunchAgentsDir returns the current user's LaunchAgents directory.

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/placing-content-in-a-bundle

### Methods

```go
func (b AppBundle) AddHelperExecutable(src string, name ...string) []Step
```
AddHelperExecutable returns the steps required to add an additional
executable to the bundle's Contents/Helpers directory, such as a tool that
a native messaging helper invokes, or a helper shared by more than one
browser. name defaults to the base name of src.

Each executable added this way is a separate Mach-O and so must be signed in
its own right, before the bundle that contains it, see SignHelper.


```go
func (b AppBundle) AddNativeMessagingHelper(h NativeMessagingHelper, browsers ...BrowserType) []Step
```
AddNativeMessagingHelper returns the steps required to add a native
messaging helper to the bundle: the Contents/Helpers directory is
created, the helper is copied into it, and a manifest is written into
Contents/Resources/NativeMessagingHosts/<browser> for each browser. Each
manifest is validated for the browser it is written for. Safari does not use
native messaging manifests and is rejected.


```go
func (b AppBundle) AddSafariWebExtension(ext SafariWebExtension) []Step
```
AddSafariWebExtension returns the steps required to add a Safari web
extension to the bundle: the .appex is created in Contents/PlugIns with the
Info.plist that identifies it as a web extension, the handler executable
is copied into it, and the extension's own resources are copied into its
Resources directory.


```go
func (b AppBundle) Clean() Step
```
Clean returns a Step that removes the app bundle directory and all its
contents.

a shipped application would normally install its own manifest when it runs.
Safari does not use native messaging manifests and is rejected.


```go
func (b AppBundle) InstallProvisioningProfile(profile string) Step
```
InstallProvisioningProfile returns a Step that copies
the provisioning profile into the app bundle. See
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3125-inside-code-signing-provisioning-profiles
for an explanation of provisioning profiles.

```
NativeMessagingManifest returns the manifest for h as it is written into the
bundle, with Path set to the helper's installed location and Type defaulted
to "stdio". If a browser is specified, the configuration is tailored to
that browser (e.g. AllowedOrigins for Chrome/Edge, AllowedExtensions for
Firefox).


```go
func (b AppBundle) NativeMessagingManifestPath(h NativeMessagingHelper, browser BrowserType) string
```
NativeMessagingManifestPath returns the path within the bundle of
the manifest written for browser, relative to the bundle's Resources
directory. An installer copies this file into the directory returned by
NativeMessagingHostsDir.


```go
func (b AppBundle) Notarize(cfg NotaryConfig) []Step
```
Notarize returns the steps that submit the bundle to Apple's notarization
service and staple the resulting ticket into it. The bundle must already be
signed with a Developer ID identity using the hardened runtime and a secure

func (b AppBundle) PlugIns(elem ...string) string
```
PlugIns returns the path to elem within the bundle's Contents/PlugIns
directory, which is where an application extension is placed.


```go
func (b AppBundle) Resources(elem ...string) string

bundle.


```go
func (b AppBundle) SetExecutablePermissions(src string, perms fs.FileMode) Step
```
SetExecutablePermissions returns a Step that sets the permissions of
the executable referenced in the Info.plist within the app bundle. If
Info.CFBundleExecutable is not set and src is provided, filepath.Base(src)
is used.

bundle's Contents/Helpers directory.


```go
func (b AppBundle) SignNativeMessagingHelper(signer Signer, h NativeMessagingHelper) Step
```
SignNativeMessagingHelper returns the step required to sign the helper
within the app bundle. A helper is a separate executable and so must be
signed before the bundle that contains it.


```go
func (b AppBundle) SignSafariWebExtension(signer Signer, ext SafariWebExtension) []Step
```
SignSafariWebExtension returns the steps required to sign the extension's
.appex within the app bundle: the handler executable inside the .appex
is signed first, and then the .appex bundle itself. An .appex is a nested
bundle and so must be signed inside out, and before the bundle that contains
it.


```go
func (b AppBundle) Staple() Step
```
Staple returns a Step that staples a notarization ticket into the bundle so
that Gatekeeper can validate it offline.


```go
func (b AppBundle) VerifyContents(signer Signer, dst ...string) Step

	Extra map[string]any `yaml:",inline"`
}
```
InfoPlist represents the contents of a macOS bundle's Info.plist file.
Commonly used keys have fields of their own; every other key is captured by
Extra, so an InfoPlist round-trips without loss.

### Type LaunchAgent
```go
type LaunchAgent struct {
	// Plist describes the job. Its Label names both the installed file and the
	// launchd service, so it must be set.
	Plist LaunchAgentPlist

	// Dir is the directory the plist is installed into. If empty,
	// UserLaunchAgentsDir is used. Set it to install elsewhere, or in tests.
	Dir string

	// Domain is the launchd domain the job is bootstrapped into, eg. "gui/501".
	// If empty, GUIDomain for the current user is used.
	Domain string
}
```
LaunchAgent manages the installation of a launchd job as a per-user
LaunchAgent, ie. a plist in ~/Library/LaunchAgents that launchd starts when
the user logs in.

A LaunchAgent rather than a system-wide LaunchDaemon is the right choice
for a job that needs a logged-in user's GUI session, for example to use
Virtualization.framework.

### Methods

```go
func (l LaunchAgent) Install() []Step
```
Install returns the steps that write the job's plist and load it:
any previously loaded instance is booted out first, so Install doubles as a
reinstall of a changed job.


```go
func (l LaunchAgent) IsInstalled() bool
```
IsInstalled reports whether the job's plist is present. It says nothing
about whether launchd has the job loaded; use Status for that.


```go
func (l LaunchAgent) PlistPath() (string, error)
```
PlistPath returns the path the job's plist is installed at.


```go
func (l LaunchAgent) Restart() Step
```
Restart returns a Step that restarts the job, starting it if it is loaded
but not running.


```go
func (l LaunchAgent) ServiceTarget() (string, error)
```
ServiceTarget returns the launchd service target for the job, ie. the domain
and label that launchctl subcommands operate on.


```go
func (l LaunchAgent) Status() Step
```
Status returns a Step that prints launchd's view of the job. launchctl
reports a useful message for a job that is not loaded, so the step succeeds
either way.


```go
func (l LaunchAgent) Uninstall() []Step
```
Uninstall returns the steps that unload the job and remove its plist.
It succeeds whether or not the job is currently loaded or installed.




### Type LaunchAgentPlist
```go
type LaunchAgentPlist struct {
	Label string `yaml:"Label"`
	// ProgramArguments is the command to run and its arguments. launchd also
	// accepts a Program key instead, which has no field here and can be
	// supplied via Extra.
	ProgramArguments []string `yaml:"ProgramArguments"`
	// RunAtLoad and KeepAlive are written only when true, since launchd treats
	// an absent key as false.
	RunAtLoad            bool              `yaml:"RunAtLoad"`
	KeepAlive            bool              `yaml:"KeepAlive"`
	EnvironmentVariables map[string]string `yaml:"EnvironmentVariables"`
	StandardOutPath      string            `yaml:"StandardOutPath"`
	StandardErrorPath    string            `yaml:"StandardErrorPath"`

	Extra map[string]any `yaml:",inline"`
}
```
LaunchAgentPlist represents the contents of a launchd job plist, ie.
a LaunchAgent or LaunchDaemon. As for InfoPlist, keys without a field of
their own are captured by Extra.

### Methods

func (lap LaunchAgentPlist) MarshalPlist() (any, error)
```


```go
func (lap LaunchAgentPlist) MarshalYAML() (any, error)
```


```go
func (lap LaunchAgentPlist) Validate() error
```
Validate reports whether the keys launchd requires of a job are present: a
Label, and something to run, ie. ProgramArguments or a Program key supplied
via Extra.




### Type NSExtensionPlist
```go
type NSExtensionPlist struct {
	// NSExtensionPointIdentifier names the kind of extension, eg.
	// SafariWebExtensionPointIdentifier.
	NSExtensionPointIdentifier string `yaml:"NSExtensionPointIdentifier"`
	// NSExtensionPrincipalClass names the class that Safari instantiates to
	// handle requests, ie. the one that receives native messages.
	NSExtensionPrincipalClass string         `yaml:"NSExtensionPrincipalClass"`
	Extra                     map[string]any `yaml:",inline"`
}
```
NSExtensionPlist represents the contents of an NSExtension dictionary,
which appears within the Info.plist of an application extension, such as the
.appex that contains a Safari web extension. As for InfoPlist, keys without
a field of their own are captured by Extra.

### Methods

```go
func (n NSExtensionPlist) MarshalPlist() (any, error)
```


```go
func (n NSExtensionPlist) MarshalYAML() (any, error)
```


```go
func (n NSExtensionPlist) Validate() error
```

### Type NativeMessagingHelper
```go
type NativeMessagingHelper struct {
	// Executable is the path to the built helper binary that is copied into
	// the bundle.
	Executable string

	// Name is the name of the helper within the bundle. It defaults to the
	// base name of Executable.
	Name string

	// Config is the manifest for the helper. Its Path is filled in by
	// Manifest and need not be set; Type defaults to "stdio".
	Config NativeMessagingConfig

	// InstalledBundlePath is the location the bundle will occupy once
	// installed, such as /Applications/Example.app. The manifest must name
	// the helper's path as it will be at runtime, which is not where the
	// bundle is built. It defaults to the bundle's own path, which is
	// appropriate when the bundle is used from where it is built.
	InstalledBundlePath string
}
```
NativeMessagingHelper describes a native messaging host that is shipped
inside an app bundle, so that a browser extension can launch it.

The helper is an executable placed in the bundle's Contents/Helpers
directory, alongside a manifest for each browser it serves. The manifest
names the absolute path of the helper, which is where the bundle will be
once installed rather than where it is built, hence InstalledBundlePath.


### Type NativeMessagingScope
```go
type NativeMessagingScope int

UserScope NativeMessagingScope = iota
// SystemScope installs the manifest for all users, which requires
// privileges to write outside of the user's home directory.
SystemScope

```



### Methods

```go
func (s NativeMessagingScope) String() string
```




### Type NotaryConfig
```go
type NotaryConfig struct {

	// AppleID, TeamID and Password provide credentials directly when a keychain
	// profile is not used. To avoid exposing credentials in the process table,
	// Password should use `@keychain:<item>` or `@env:<VAR_NAME>` reference syntax.
	AppleID  string `yaml:"apple_id"`
	TeamID   string `yaml:"team_id"`
	Password string `yaml:"password"`
	// Arguments, if set, replaces the default authentication arguments entirely.

```
SafariWebExtension describes a Safari web extension that is shipped inside
an app bundle. Safari does not launch a separate native messaging host the
way Chrome and Firefox do: a web extension is packaged as an application
extension, an .appex within the containing app's Contents/PlugIns, and
messages sent by the extension with runtime.sendNativeMessage are delivered
to the principal class of that .appex. That class is the native helper.

Only Safari web extensions are supported. The older Safari app extensions,
which use the com.apple.Safari.extension extension point and do not use a
manifest.json, are rejected.
