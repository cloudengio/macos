Usage: `gobundle` --help|run|build|install|... [options]

    `gobundle` makes it easy (and transparent) to create go applications as macOS
    bundles and hence to be signed with entitlements and with embedded provisioning
    profiles. It is intended to ease the development flow whilst working with the
    macOS security model (and without having to disable security and sandboxing on
    development machines).

    `gobundle` wraps the go command, and in particular 'go run', 'go build' and 'go
    install' to build the go executable and to transparently build a macOS bundle
    using the executable. `gobundle` run|build|install <args> invokes go run|build|install
    with <args>. For run it uses go run's -exec hook to capture the created executable
    and to build an app bundle in a temporary directly and to run the executable
    from the bundle. For build and install it creates the app bundle, moves the
    executable into the bundle and creates a soft link to the executable in the app
    bundle at the location at which go build would have left the executable. Executing
    the soft link is then equivalent to executing the executable in the bundle. For
    build and install it uses the same heuristics as the go command to determine
    the name and location of the executable.

    `gobundle` is configured using environment variables and YAML configuration files
    that use the types in cloudeng.io/macos/buildtools.
    The config file format is as follows:

        identity:       - signing identity
        codesign-args:  - array of additional arguments to codesign
        bundle:         - path to the app bundle to create, if empty <binary>.app is used
        profile:        - path to the provisioning profile to embed in the app bundle,
                          it can include environment variables
        entitlements:   - a dictionary of entitlements to embed in the app
        info.plist:     - a dictionary of fields that correspond to info.Plist entries.

    For example:
        identity: "Apple Development: You (Your Team ID)"
        entitlements:
            com.apple.security.app-sandbox: true
        profile: $HOME/Downloads/example_app.provisionprofile
        info.plist:
            CFBundleIdentifier: <your-team-id>com.you.example

    Environment variables can be used in any string value and are expanded before use.
    This makes it possible to hide sensitive information such as a signing identity
    from checked in files.

    To make managing shared configurations easier, two config files of the same
    format are used. One is intended to be shared across multiple apps and the other
    is intended to be app specific. The app specific file is merged with the shared
    one, overriding any duplicate keys. A common convention is to have signing
    information in the shared file and app specific information such as the bundle
    identifier and the provisioning profile in the app specific file. The merged
    file is written to the app bundle as Resources/gobundle.yml.
    The shared file is searched for in the following locations:
     1. The file specified by the environment variable GOBUNDLE_SHARED_CONFIG
     2. The current directory for files named: .gobundle-shared.yaml
        or `gobundle`-shared.yml
     3. The user's home directory for files named: .gobundle-shared.yaml
        or `gobundle`-shared.yml

    The app specific file is searched for in the following locations:
     1. The file specified by the environment variable GOBUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
     2. The current directory for files named: .gobundle-app.yml
        or `gobundle`-app.yml
     3. The user's home directory for files named: .gobundle-app.yaml
        or `gobundle`-app.yml

    In all cases .yaml may be used instead of .yml.

    In addition, setting GOBUNDLE_VERBOSE to any non-empty value will enable verbose logging.

    Examples:
      `gobundle` build ./cmd/myapp
      `gobundle` run ./cmd/myapp
      `gobundle` install ./cmd/myapp
