const usage = `Usage: gobundle --help|run|build|install|... [options]`

const para1 = `gobundle makes it easy (and transparent) to create go applications
as macOS bundles and hence to be signed with entitlements and
with embedded provisioning profiles.
It is intended to ease the development flow whilst working with the
macOS security model (and without having
to disable security and sandboxing on development machines).
`

const para2 = `
gobundle wraps the go command, and in particular 'go run', 'go build'
and 'go install' to build the go executable and to
transparently build a macOS bundle using the executable.
gobundle run|build|install <args> invokes go run|build|install with <args>.
For run it uses go run's -exec hook to capture the created executable
and to build an app bundle in a temporary directly and to run the
executable from the bundle.
For build and install it creates the app bundle,
moves the executable into the bundle and
creates a soft link to the executable in the app bundle at the location
at which go build would have left the executable.
Executing the soft link is then equivalent to executing the executable in the bundle.
For build and install it uses the same heuristics as the go command to determine the name and location of the executable.
`

const para3 = `
gobundle is configured using environment variables and YAML configuration files that use the types in cloudgeng.io/macos/buildtools.
`

const para4 = `
The config file format is as follows:

    identity:       - signing identity
    codesign-args:  - array of additional arguments to codesign
    bundle:         - path to the app bundle to create, if empty <binary>.app is used
    profile:        - path to the provisioning profile to embed in the app bundle,
                      it can include environment variables
    entitlements:   - a dictionary of entitlements to embed in the app
    info.plist:     - a dictionary of fields that correspond to info.Plist entries.

For example:
    identity: "Apple Development: You (Your Team ID)"
    entitlements:
        com.apple.security.app-sandbox: true
    profile: $HOME/Downloads/example_app.provisionprofile
    info.plist:
        CFBundleIdentifier: <your-team-id>com.you.example
`

const para5 = `
To make managing shared configurations easier, two config files of the
same format are used.
One is intended to be shared across multiple apps and the other is intended
to be app specific.
The app specific file is merged with the shared one, overriding any
duplicate keys.
A common convention is to have signing information in the shared file
and app specific information such as the
bundle identifier and the provisioning profile in the app specific file.
The merged file is written to the app bundle as Resources/gobundle.yml.
`

const para6 = ` 
The shared file is searched for in the following locations:
 1. The file specified by the environment variable GOBUNDLE_SHARED_CONFIG
 2. The current directory for files named: .gobundle-shared.yaml
    or gobundle-shared.yml
 3. The user's home directory for files named: .gobundle-shared.yaml
    or gobundle-shared.yml

The app specific file is searched for in the following locations:
 1. The file specified by the environment variable GOBUNDLE_APP_CONFIG
 2. The current directory for files named: .gobundle-app.yml
    or gobundle-app.yml
 3. The user's home directory for files named: .gobundle-app.yaml
    or gobundle-app.yml

In all cases .yaml may be used instead of .yml.

In addition, setting GOBUNDLE_VERBOSE to any non-empty value will enable verbose logging.

Examples:
  gobundle build ./cmd/myapp
  gobundle run ./cmd/myapp
  gobundle install ./cmd/myapp
